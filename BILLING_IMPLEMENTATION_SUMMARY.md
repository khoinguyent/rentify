  - 2 fixed fees (parking $150, service fee $100)
  - 5% percentage discount
  - 4 usage records (Jan & Feb electricity + water)
  - 1 paid invoice with full breakdown

- ✅ **Quarterly lease** with:
  - 3-month billing cycle
  - $500 fixed discount per quarter
  - Management fee (fixed)

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### Flexible Billing Cycles
```typescript
{
  billingCycleMonths: 1,  // Monthly
  billingCycleMonths: 3,  // Quarterly
  billingCycleMonths: 6,  // Semi-annual
  billingCycleMonths: 12, // Annual
}
```

### Fixed vs Variable Fees
```typescript
// Fixed Fee (same amount every period)
{
  type: "FIXED",
  amount: 150  // $150/month
}

// Variable Fee (based on usage)
{
  type: "VARIABLE",
  unitPrice: 0.15,  // $0.15 per unit
  billingUnit: "kWh"
}
```

### Discount Support
```typescript
// Percentage Discount
{
  discountType: "PERCENT",
  discountValue: 10  // 10% off
}

// Fixed Discount
{
  discountType: "FIXED",
  discountValue: 500  // $500 off
}
```

### Automatic Invoice Generation
- Calculates correct billing periods
- Multiplies fees by billing cycle months
- Aggregates usage records
- Applies discounts
- Creates detailed line items
- Auto-generates invoice numbers (INV-YYYYMM-XXXX)

## 📊 Invoice Calculation Example

**Lease Setup:**
- Rent: $3000/month
- Billing Cycle: 1 month (monthly)
- Discount: 5% (PERCENT)

**Fees:**
- Electricity (VARIABLE): $0.15/kWh
- Water (VARIABLE): $2.50/m³
- Parking (FIXED): $150/month
- Service Fee (FIXED): $100/month

**Usage for October:**
- Electricity: 150 kWh = $22.50
- Water: 15 m³ = $37.50

**Invoice Breakdown:**
```
Rent (1 month):              $3000.00
Electricity (150 kWh):         $22.50
Water (15 m³):                 $37.50
Parking (1 month):            $150.00
Service Fee (1 month):        $100.00
─────────────────────────────────────
Subtotal:                    $3310.00
Discount (5%):               -$165.50
─────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL:                       $3144.50
```
